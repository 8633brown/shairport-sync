Uninstalling Shairport Sync
====
This is under construction.

<!---
When Shairport Sync is installed using `# make install`, it does the following:
1. A `shairport-sync` user and group are defined;
1. It installs an executable at `/usr/bin/local/shairport-sync`;
1. It installs configuration files at `/etc/shairport-sync.conf` and `/etc/shairport-sync.conf.sample` or at `/usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf` and `/usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf.sample`
1. It installs a startup script. The startup script used depends on the type of system:
    1. In a `systemd` Linux system (most modern Linuxes), it installs a startup script at `/lib/systemd/system/shairport-sync.service`;
    1. In a System V Linux system, it installs a startup script at `/etc/init.d/shairport-sync`;
    1. In FreeBSD, it installs a startup script at `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/shairport_sync`;
    1. In CYGWIN, it installs a configuration script at `/usr/local/bin/shairport-sync-config`;
1. If the D-Bus or MPRIS interfaces have been enabled, it installs a policy file at `/etc/dbus-1/system.d/shairport-sync-dbus.conf`;
