Shairport Sync
=============
Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player â€“ it plays audio streamed from iTunes, iOS, Apple TV and macOS devices and AirPlay sources such as Quicktime Player and [ForkedDaapd](http://ejurgensen.github.io/forked-daapd/), among others.

Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. In this way, synchronised multi-room audio is possible for players that support it, such as iTunes.

Shairport Sync runs on Linux and FreeBSD. It does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.

**Warning**

This is the very unstable "transit" branch. It is used to move unfinished or untested code between development sites.

To access the stable version, where changes are made after due time, please switch to the "master" branch.
