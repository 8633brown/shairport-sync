Shairport Sync
=============
Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player â€“ it plays audio streamed from iTunes, iOS, Apple TV and macOS devices and AirPlay sources such as Quicktime Player and [ForkedDaapd](http://ejurgensen.github.io/forked-daapd/), among others.

Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. In this way, synchronised multi-room audio is possible for players that support it, such as iTunes.

Shairport Sync runs on Linux and FreeBSD. It does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.

**Warning**

This is the "unstable" branch. It is used for very preliminary unfinished or untested code and can change at any time and without warning.
